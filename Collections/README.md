# Collections
  
  This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose
  built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

# Collections.Counter()

    A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>> 
    myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
    print Counter(myList)
    Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
    
    >>>
    print Counter(myList).items()
    [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
    
    >>> 
    print Counter(myList).keys()
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    >>> 
    print Counter(myList).values()
    [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]
